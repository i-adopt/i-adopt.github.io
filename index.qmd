title: "InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology WG (RDA I-ADOPT WG)"
---

## I-ADOPT in a nutshell

Under the auspices of the Research Data Alliance (RDA) [Vocabulary and Semantic Services Interest Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/rationale/vocabulary-services-interest-group/) (VSSIG) a small number of semantic experts formed a task group in 2018 to address the interoperability of observational data. The group submitted a [case statement](https://www.rd-alliance.org/app/uploads/2024/05/I-ADOPT20WG20case20statement.pdf) to work on the development of a common method to systematically express or represent observable properties in May 2019.

The [RDA WG I-ADOPT](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/interoperable-descriptions-observable-property-terminology-wg-i-adopt-wg/) was officially launched in 2019 and has 131 members. The WG completed its 18-month workplan in 2021.

Find here all performed tasks and their outputs:

**Task 1**: Collect [user stories](https://github.com/i-adopt/users_stories) and formalise them into [use cases](https://github.com/i-adopt/usecase_analysis/blob/master/use_case_groups.csv) (November 2019 - February 2020)

**Task 2**: [Survey](https://github.com/i-adopt/terminology-survey/blob/master/terminology_questionnaire.pdf) existing observation-centric terminologies (January 2020 - February 2020)

**Task 3**: Derive [use case requirements](https://github.com/i-adopt/requirements) (March 2020 - April 2020)

**Task 4**: Analyse semantic representation of Observable Properties against requirements (May 2020 - October 2020)

**Task 5**: Develop the [Interoperability Framework](https://w3id.org/iadopt/ont/) (November 2020 - April 2021)

**Task 6**: Test local mapping [design patterns](https://github.com/i-adopt/patterns) (May 2021 - September 2021)

The **I-ADOPT recommendations** were finalized in January 2022 and **endorsed by RDA** in April 2022 ([DOI: 10.15497/RDA00071](https://zenodo.org/records/6520132#.YnOhMJNBybQ)). The Working Group is in maintenance mode, but is still active in refining the I-ADOPT Framework and helping with its implementation. You can contribute to this Working Group by submitting your own [variables](https://github.com/i-adopt/variables), submitting your [questions](https://github.com/i-adopt/questions) and working with us in our recurring meetings.

## Main Outcomes

The [**I-ADOPT Framework Ontology**](https://w3id.org/iadopt/ont/) is a lightweight ontology primarily designed to facilitate interoperability between existing variable description models (including ontologies, taxonomy, and structured controlled vocabularies).

![](img/ontology.jpg)

In 2023 we extended the ontology to support the aggregation of variables using a range of user-defined coarser concepts to facilitate dataset discovery and aggregation into products.

![](img/extension.jpg)

The [**I-ADOPT Catalogue of Terminologies**](https://i-adopt.github.io/terminologies/) contains concepts from terminologies to compose semantic variable descriptions.

The [**Step-by-Step guide**](https://github.com/i-adopt/supplementary/tree/master/step-by-step) was created to support in the description of new variables.

## An Example

Applying the I-ADOPT Framework means:

1.  decompose the variable in atomic components
2.  assign a description role for each component
3.  annotate each component with concepts from terminologies

![](img/example.jpg)

This I-ADOPT decomposition and annotation exercise should result in a variable concept with its associated concepts in a SKOS vocabulary:

See [here](https://w3id.org/ozcar-theia/c_f120f651) the variable represented as SKOS concept from the [Theia/OZCAR Thesaurus](https://in-situ.theia-land.fr/skosmos/theia_ozcar_thesaurus/en/).
