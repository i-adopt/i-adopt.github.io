    "text": "The Challenge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on detailed instructions and participation rules, participants will independently decompose the same set of variables into atomic description components according to the I-ADOPT recommendations, using concepts from applicable terminologies.\nThe aim of the challenge is to reveal, in a controlled setting, the similarities and differences in the way the I-ADOPT Framework is used between independent teams. The findings will certainly support the enhancement of the I-ADOPT Framework. The activity will highlight possible bottlenecks but also opportunities to extend or modify the underlying ontology and help to feed the modelling patterns knowledge base. Ultimately, the findings from this Challenge will be used to develop a semi-automated I-ADOPT variable annotation service.\nLet’s challenge the I-ADOPT Framework together!\n\n\n\nPhoto credits"

We are preparing a set of variables to be included in the Challenge based on these criteria:\n\nvariables from different domains\nvariables with a short description\nvariables that are not too complex\n\nExamples:\n\nSoil texture: Classification of soil by the proportion and graduations of the three size groups of soil grains, i.e., sand, silt and clay, present in the soil.\nWater salinity of stagnant surface water: Salinity is the saltiness or dissolved salt content of a body of water.\nNumber of nights in a 3-star hotel near the sea shore: Number of nights of tourists in a 3-star hotel that is placed near the sea shore.\n\nYou are invited to submit up to three variables before August 18.\nThe Challenge organizers will make a selection that is most suitable for the Challenge. The variables not selected will be documented after the Challenge.\n\nPropose variables\nIf you are interested and would like to be kept informed, please share your details.\nAttention: Subscription to the Challenge opens on September 2.\nStay tuned"
