    "text": "Outcomes of the first I-ADOPT Variable Modeling Workshop\nIn the first I-ADOPT Variable Modeling Workshop (February 20&21 at the Museum of Natural History, Vienna) we introduced and discussed different relevant models that can be combined to represent observations: OMS, SensorThings API, a SensorThingsAPI generation service, and finally also the I-ADOPT model. One critical issue, heavily discussed, was how to connect the feature type of OMS with a specific description component in I-ADOPT. There is no easy answer and no easy pattern to follow although initially the ContextObject was identified to be the most appropriate. We clarified the notion of the Matrix to be an element rather than an object that might be measured in time and space. We have abandoned the idea that Matrix must be included in every variable which includes a ContextObject. A specific use case is how to handle distance variables where we identified symmetric and asymmetric scenarios. We discussed the potential modification of the I-ADOPT model to allow Constraints on Properties and identified a few us cases to be described before we can decide. Special attention was given to the concept of “product”, which could complement I-ADOPT to allow the description of observations with information on how these variables should be properly monitored, i.e. adding spatial and temporal resolution triggered by the EBV case study. These and other patterns are being described in the patterns repository. We decided to continue working on case studies around biodiversity, marine, and freshwater using GitHub issues and a template that allows us to include annotations to address additional OMS concepts. A side activity was the upload of I-ADOPT aligned EBVs in EcoPortal (as they are also uploaded in OGC Rainbow server) and the small project to start a variable definition pipeline using nanopublications via EcoPortal. A key result is that I-ADOPT can be used to give the OMS observable property FAIR context information for data streams. However, I-ADOPT can also be used independently to enrich metadata.\n\nParticipant list\nModeling subgroup:\n\nBarbara Magagna, GO FAIR Foundation, NL (RDA WG I-ADOPT, co-chair)\nSirko Schindler, German Aerospace Center, DE (RDA WG I-ADOPT, technical lead)\nKatharina Schleidt, DataCove (OGC OMS - chair, TSML, conceptual modeller)\nHylke van der Schaaf, Fraunhofer IOSB, DE (OGC - STA, chair)\nRob Atkinson, OGC, AU (Spatial Data on the Web WG, co-chair)\nRaul Palma, PSNC, PL (AD4GD - EBV, FAIR2Adapt)\nJoan Masó, CREAF, ES (AD4GD - EBV)\n\nMarine subgroup:\n\nGwenaelle Moncoiffe, BODC, GB (RDA WG I-ADOPT, co-chair, content manager of NVS)\nLorenzo Corgnati, CNR-ISMAR, IT (EuroGOOS, JERICO)\nAnne Fouilloux, Simula, NO (FAIR2Adapt - coordinator)\n\nBiodiversity subgroup:\n\nIvette Serral, CREAF, ES (AD4GD - EBV)\nVictoria Lush, Aston University, GB (AD4GD - EBV)\nMarina Pulieri, University of Salento, IT (LifeWatch Italy, EcoPortal)\nAndrea Tarallo, CNR, IT (LifeWatch Italy, ITINERIS)\n\nFreshwater subgroup:\n\nPhilipp Saile, Federal Institute of Hydrology, DE (UNEP GEMS/Water, WMO WHOS)\nKatarina Řiháčková, Masaryk University, SK (PARC)\n\nOnline participants:\n\nSylvain Grellet, BRGM, FR (OGC OMS, HydroDWG, WMO WHOS, Water4all/OneWater, PARC)\nCharly Coussot, IRD, FR (French OZCAR Water Research Infrastructure)"

    "text": "Outcomes of the second I-ADOPT Variable Modeling Workshop\nIn the second I-ADOPT Variable Modelling Workshop (March 10&11 at the Environment Agency Austria, Vienna) we presented the outcomes and patterns we discovered during the first workshop and introduced an initial workflow for the development of an LLM-enabled annotation service based on I-ADOPT. The variables in focus were provided by the meteorological and atmospheric domain. After a presentation on the current developments and efforts in WMO on the WIGOS Metadata Representation, we discussed specific complex variables and their decomposition. This process led to Application Design Records (ADRs) which list options for each encountered design problem and on which the I-ADOPT core team will vote and agree to provide reusable patterns. We also identified rules of alignment between the property type in I-ADOPT and the type of the Feature of Interest in OMS based on examples of the I-ADOPT Challenge analysed, but further analysis is required on a bigger set of examples. A key insight of the modelling discussion revealed the requirement to model a system of elements for any entity in I-ADOPT and these elements can be of any I-ADOPT nature (variables, properties, entities). In addition, we agreed on the requirement to include statistical modifiers (maximum, average, …) in the description.\nA common practice of domain-specific vocabularies applying I-ADOPT (see ACTRIS vocabulary is to design I-ADOPT roles as classes which is only possible if the same concepts appear in the same position in the descriptions. This might be possible for a specific domain but requires clear modelling guidance for the domain with key demo examples provided by leading authorities like WMO. In addition, we further discussed properties required for the product description, where ISO 10131 (Data Product Specification - DPS) can give some directions but the real implementation will most likely not go via ISO but via OMS SWG.\nThe I-ADOPT service developer team defined a harmonised roadmap identifying tasks needed to implement the service. The service should allow decomposing a human-readable variable description in I-ADOPT description elements, recognize existing I-ADOPT variables and propose them to the user or annotate the variable elements with concepts from semantic artefacts. The result should be a JSON file that can be exported in turtle and a mapping to existing variables. One challenge was not yet addressed in detail but will need more attention later: the further formalization of constraints to allow better machine readability.\n\nPotential collaborations:\n\nI-ADOPT service development with developers from FAIR2Adapt, NFDI4Earth project and PARC\nI-ADOPT variables modelled for WIGOS vocabulary and for the Atmospheric Composition Variable Name Concent (ASVSNC) involving modellers from the WIGOS, NASA and CF Standard Names\nWMDR 2.0 proposal includes properties which are interesting for the product model in line with I-ADOPT-DPS-STA - a collaboration between modellers from WIGOS, AD4GD and OMS together with some RIs like eLTER, and projects like PARC and FAIR2Adapt would make it\n\n\n\nNext steps:\n\nI-ADOPT Core team decides on the ADRs and publishes patterns\nI-ADOPT revises the challenge variables to provide a set of curated variables (L0) (deadline: April 10, 2025)\nThe service developers will define on top of these variable definitions and the patterns the benchmark level L0 (April - May 2025)\nThe domain communities revise their variable descriptions based on the variable modelling patterns using the template indicating also if the variable requires a sample (May 2025)\nThe core I-ADOPT team provides a clean list of L1 variables as summary of the community input (June 2025)\nThe developer team creates synthetic data via the service (L2) (July-August 2025)\nL2 will be validated by modelling and domain experts (Sept 2025)\n\n\n\nParticipant list\nModeling subgroup:\n\nBarbara Magagna, GO FAIR Foundation, NL (RDA WG I-ADOPT, co-chair)\nSirko Schindler, German Aerospace Center, DE (RDA WG I-ADOPT, technical lead)\nKatharina Schleidt, DataCove (OGC OMS - chair, TSML, conceptual modeller)\nIvette Serral, CREAF, ES (AD4GD - EBV)\n\nMetereological subgroup:\n\nGao Chen, NASA, US (ACVSNC - Langley Research Center, lead)\nMorgan Silverman, NASA, US (ACVSNC - Langley Research Center, data scientist)\nJörg Klausen, MeteoSwiss, CH (WMO TT - WIGOSMD, chair)\nAlison Pamment, Centre for Environmental Data Analysis/Sience and Technology Facilities Council, UK (CF Convention, I-ADOPT core team)\nJohannes Peterseil, Environment Agency Austria (eLTER RI, technical lead)\n\nI-ADOPT service developer subgroup:\n\nJosé Manuel Gomez, Expert.AI, ES (FAIR2Adapt, developer)\nCristian Berrio Aroca, Expert.AI, ES (FAIR2Adapt, developer)\nÈsteban Gonzalez, UPM, ES (FAIR2Adapt, developer)\nArvin Rastegar, KIT, DE (NFDI4Earth, developer)\nSaurav Kumar, IISPV, ES (PARC, semantic expert)\n\nOnline participants:\n\nIseult Lynch, University of Birmingham, UK (PARC - FAIR lead)\nMarkus Fiebig, NILU, NO (ACTRIS - atmospheric scientist)\nBeth Huffer, NASA, US (Lingua Logica, semantic expert)"
