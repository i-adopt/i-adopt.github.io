</div>

I-ADOPT aims to facilitate **data interoperability** by offering a common framework to\
**describe variables** and **connect terminologies** used to name variables.\
The I-ADOPT recommendations, endorsed by RDA, are now a candidate OGC standard.

The Challenge took place from 16 to 29 September 2024.

* **1st place:** Anne Fouilloux and Jean Iaquinta (212.75 points)
* **2nd place:** Andrea Tarallo, Martina Pulieri, Christina Di Muri e Jessica Titocci (206.5 points)
* **3rd place:** Jörg Klausen, Morgan Silverman and Gao Chen (168.6 points)


The RDA TIGER Programme will provide the first prize: **travel and registration support to the 23rd RDA Plenary in Costa Rica** (12-14 November 2024). We are currently contacting the RDA TIGER group and the winners and will publish the prizes soon.

**Runner-up contestants**:

Petra ten Hoopen, Samantha Blakeman, Saurav Kumar

These people will automatically qualify for a share in the prize pot of our second challenge (details below).

## Second Challenge

We decided to launch a second challenge that will take place 

from **October 14 (10:00 CEST) to 18 (22:00 CEST)** 

using the same ([Presentation](material/I-ADOPT Challenge Rules - presentation version.pdf){target="_blank"}).
However, this time we will select 10 from the 30 variables that had the greatest variance in modeling. The new selection will be published on Monday, October 14.

We have **1000 Euro in the prize pool** for the second challenge.

There will be no single winner, but everyone contributing with at least 5 high-quality variable models will get an equal amount from the prize pot.
High-quality is defined by a variable that scores 12 points or higher. Please, find details about the score distribution in the ([Presentation](material/I-ADOPT Challenge Rules - presentation version.pdf){target="_blank"}).
Anyone can join, except for the three winners of the first challenge.

The runner-up contestants from the first challenge have already qualified (and thus don’t need to actively participate anymore) based on their submissions and will be rewarded with an equal share of the prize pot, along with the new contestants who qualify.

Participation is definitely worthwhile because modeling 5 variables does not take long but it definitely helps to understand the framework. For us, on the other hand, your input is extremely useful because we can tailor future services and documentation much better to the needs of users.

We will put models of the other 20 variables from the first challenge in the ([examples repository](https://github.com/i-adopt/examples){target="_blank"}) so that participants can use them for inspiration and reference.

<div>

Based on detailed instructions and participation rules, participants will independently decompose the same set of variables into atomic description components according to the I-ADOPT recommendations, using concepts from applicable terminologies.

The aim of the challenge is to reveal, in a controlled setting, the similarities and differences in the way the I-ADOPT Framework is used between independent teams. The findings will certainly support the enhancement of the I-ADOPT Framework. The activity will highlight possible bottlenecks but also opportunities to extend or modify the underlying ontology and help to feed the modelling patterns knowledge base. Ultimately, the findings from this Challenge will be used to develop a semi-automated I-ADOPT variable annotation service.

**Let's challenge the I-ADOPT Framework together!**
