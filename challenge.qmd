## Announcement

**I-ADOPT aims to facilitate data interoperability** by offering a common framework to\
**describe variables** and **connect terminologies** used to name variables.\
The I-ADOPT recommendations, endorsed by RDA, are now a candidate OGC standard.

We would like to invite you to test I-ADOPT in the Variable Modelling Challenge!

Modelers, semantic experts, data stewards and researchers from around the world -\
**Can you try to model a given set of variables according to the I-ADOPT Framework?**

Top scorers will be rewarded with a prize!

## The Challenge

::: {#second-column}
Based on detailed instructions and participation rules, participants will independently decompose the same set of variables into atomic description components according to the I-ADOPT recommendations, using concepts from applicable terminologies.

The aim of the challenge is to reveal, in a controlled setting, the similarities and differences in the way the I-ADOPT Framework is usedÂ between independent teams. The findings will certainly support the enhancement of the I-ADOPT Framework. The activity will highlight possible bottlenecks but also opportunities to extend or modify the underlying ontology and help to feed the modelling patterns knowledge base. Ultimately, the findings from this Challenge will be used to develop a semi-automated I-ADOPT variable annotation service.

**Let's challenge the I-ADOPT Framework together!**

## Good to know

Background information about I-ADOPT can be explored on this [website](https://i-adopt.github.io/).

## Propose a variable

Interested in proposing a set of variables for the I-ADOPT Variable Modelling Challenge? We are preparing a set of variables to be included in the Challenge based on these criteria:

-   variables from different domains
-   variables with a short description
-   variables that are not too complex

**Examples**:

-   *Soil texture:* Classification of soil by the proportion and graduations of the three size groups of soil grains, i.e., sand, silt and clay, present in the soil.
-   *Water salinity of stagnant surface water:* Salinity is the saltiness or dissolved salt content of a body of water.
-   *Number of nights in a 3-star hotel near the sea shore:* Number of nights of tourists in a 3-star hotel that is placed near the sea shore.

You are invited to submit up to three variables before August 18.\
The Challenge organizers will make a selection that is most suitable for the Challenge. The variables not selected will be documented after the Challenge.
