## Winners of the I-ADOPT Variable Modeling Challenge (First and Second Challenge)


I-ADOPT aims to facilitate **data interoperability** by offering a common framework to\
**describe variables** and **connect terminologies** used to name variables.\
The I-ADOPT recommendations, endorsed by RDA, are now a candidate OGC standard.

The First Challenge took place from 16 to 29 September 2024, the Second Challenge from 14 to 18 October 2024.

*1st prize - €400 plus 2 virtual attendance fees for RDA 23:  **Anne Fouilloux** and **Jean Iaquinta** (212.75 points) 

*2nd prize - €300 plus 1 virtual attendance fee for RDA 23*: **Andrea Tarallo, Martina Pulieri, Christina Di Muri,** and **Jessica Titocci** (208.5 points)

*3rd prize - €200*: **Jörg Klausen, Morgan Silverman and Gao Chen** (170.6 points) 

The RDA TIGER Programme sponsored the attendance fees for the winners.

The following participants have *qualified for the second challenge and will receive €100* each:

**Margherita Martorana, Samantha Blakeman, Petra ten Hoopen, Naouel Karam, Juliana Menger, Saurav Kumar,** and **Norbert van Dijk**



## Results

We have put valid models of all 30 variables from the Challenge in the ([examples repository](https://i-adopt.github.io/examples/){target="_blank"}). Be aware that other models might also be fulfilling the criteria. 

We invite to discuss different variants in the ([issues](https://github.com/i-adopt/examples/issues){target="_blank"}).

Find all contributions and detailed evaluation results in this ([sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zAQ6vFyv87VI4xxDx-cLi8CCvR8CVBSRaNOpSX_o9zo/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}).

We will analyse the results further and will present interesting outcomes at the RDA Plenary Meeting 23 in Costa Rica on Wednesday, **13 November 2024 (14:00-15:30 UTC)** in this session:
**Challenging I-ADOPT** | Venue: Edificio de Ingeniería, Classroom 40, University of Costa Rica.
