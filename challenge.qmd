# The I-ADOPT Variable Modeling Challenge

**I-ADOPT aims to facilitate data interoperability** by offering a common framework to\
**describe variables** and **connect terminologies** used to name variables.\
The I-ADOPT recommendations, endorsed by RDA, are now a candidate OGC standard.

We would like to invite you to test I-ADOPT in the Decomposition Challenge!

Modelers, semantic experts, data stewards and researchers from around the world -\
**Can you try to model a given set of variables according to the I-ADOPT Framework?**

Top scorers will be rewarded with a prize!

## The Challenge

Participants will independently decompose the same set of variables into atomic description components according to the I-ADOPT recommendations, using concepts from applicable terminologies.

We will provide detailed instructions and participation rules.

The aim of the challenge is to reveal, in a controlled setting, the similarities and differences in the way the I-ADOPT Framework is usedÂ between independent teams. The findings will ultimately support the enhancement of the I-ADOPT Framework.

## Good to know

Background information about I-ADOPT can be explored on this website.

## Propose a variable

Interested in proposing a set of variables for the Decomposition Challenge? We are preparing a set of variables to be included in the challenge based on these criteria:

-   a mix from different domains understandable and

-   not too complex

You are invited to submit up to 3 variables before August 18.\
Please include a short description of the variable. The Challenge organizers will make a selection that is most suitable for the Challenge. The variables not selected will be documented after the Challenge.

**Submit here and subscribe** to receive email updates on the challenge.
