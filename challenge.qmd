## Announcement

I-ADOPT aims to facilitate **data interoperability** by offering a common framework to\
**describe variables** and **connect terminologies** used to name variables.\
The I-ADOPT recommendations, endorsed by RDA, are now a candidate OGC standard.

We would like to invite you to test I-ADOPT in the Variable Modelling Challenge!

Modelers, semantic experts, data stewards and researchers from around the world -\
Can you try to model a given set of variables according to the I-ADOPT Framework?

The Challenge takes place in the week from 16 to 22 September 2024.

**Top scorers will be rewarded with a prize!**

The RDA TIGER Programme will provide **travel and registration support to the 23rd RDA Plenary in Costa Rica** (12-14 November 2024) for the **top winner**. If the winner is unable to attend appropriate alternatives will be provided.

## Update: The I-ADOPT Variable Modelling Challenge has now started

Find here all relevant materials, which we recommend you to study in this order: 

1. An introduction to the I-ADOPT Framework (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3thKyVVtCM" target="_blank">Video</a>,[Slides and Notes](material/I-ADOPT Framework - Slides and Notes.pdf){target="_blank"})

2. A step-by-step guide for creating an I-ADOPT compliant variable description ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43hAzmqBAfs){target="_blank"},[Slides and Notes](material/I-ADOPT Step-by-Step - Slides and Notes.pdf){target="_blank"})

3. Instructions for submitting modeled variables including participation and scoring rules ([Presentation](material/I-ADOPT Challenge Rules - presentation version.pdf){target="_blank"})

4. The list of variables to be selected ([Challenge Variables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bJdde8GH55LzzlV0A_eV_h5M7W7UXCDN6SoxcTinM74/edit?usp=sharing){target="_blank"}). 

If you have a question related to the Challenge please post it to the [Question GitHub](https://github.com/i-adopt/questions/issues){target="_blank"} as an issue. We will try to answer it promptly.

**Attention: Subscription to the Challenge ends by September 22!**

## The Challenge

</div>

<div>

Based on detailed instructions and participation rules, participants will independently decompose the same set of variables into atomic description components according to the I-ADOPT recommendations, using concepts from applicable terminologies.

The aim of the challenge is to reveal, in a controlled setting, the similarities and differences in the way the I-ADOPT Framework is used between independent teams. The findings will certainly support the enhancement of the I-ADOPT Framework. The activity will highlight possible bottlenecks but also opportunities to extend or modify the underlying ontology and help to feed the modelling patterns knowledge base. Ultimately, the findings from this Challenge will be used to develop a semi-automated I-ADOPT variable annotation service.

**Let's challenge the I-ADOPT Framework together!**
